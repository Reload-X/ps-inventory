# Credit where Credit is Due

# Thanks to loljoshie for originally creating the lj-inventory we've all come to love.
# Thanks to ok1ez and the project sloth dev team for continuing lj-inventory's existence with keeping it up to date and maintaining it as ps-inventory.
# Thanks to the Project Sloth Community. Without the support on the first version this release wouldn't be possible.
